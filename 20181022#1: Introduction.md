### [Notes]

####1. 社企定義與發問

- Social entrepreneur (n.) a person who tries to solve social problems using entrepreneurial skills.

  -  “**Social Entrepreneur** is not a traditional job, so you have to throw out all of the traditional questions,” Stoll says. “The traditional questions you ask yourself—that I asked myself when I was in your seat as a student—were these two big questions that freak out a lot of people. **What do I want to be when I grow up?** What am I going to do when I graduate?’ Let’s just get rid of those questions altogether, because I’ve got a better question. If you want to change the world, if you want to do social entrepreneurial work…the real question is **what problem do you want to solve in the world?** What problem out there just pisses you off? What problem makes you say, ‘Wow that’s frustrating. Why does that even happen?’ That’s how you become a social entrepreneur.”
